###### About Project Cyber Infrastructure Machine Learning
This program seeks to prepare, nurture, and grow the national scientific research workforce for creating, utilizing, and supporting
advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) to enable and potentially transform fundamental science and engineering research and contribute to
the Nation's overall economic competitiveness and security. The goals of this solicitation are to (i) ensure broad adoption of CI tools,
methods, and resources by the research community in order to catalyze major research advances and to enhance
researchers’ abilities to lead the development of new CI; and (ii) integrate core literacy and discipline-appropriate advanced
skills in advanced CI as well as computational and data-driven science and engineering into the Nation’s educational
curriculum/instructional material fabric spanning undergraduate and graduate courses for advancing fundamental research.
Pilot and Implementation projects may target one or both of the solicitation goals, while Large-scale Project Conceptualization projects
must address both goals. For the purpose of this solicitation, advanced CI is broadly defined as the set of resources, tools, methods,
and services for advanced computation, large-scale data handling and analytics, and networking and security for large-scale systems
that collectively enable potentially transformative fundamental research.
