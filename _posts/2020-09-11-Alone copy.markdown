ONE
A merry little surge of electricity piped by automatic alarm from the mood organ beside his
bed awakened Rick Deckard. Surprised — it always surprised him to find himself awake
without prior notice — he rose from the bed, stood up in his multicolored pajamas, and
stretched. Now, in her bed, his wife Iran opened her gray, unmerry eyes, blinked, then
groaned and shut her eyes again.



"You set your Penfield too weak he said to her. "I'll reset it and you'll be awake and — "
"Keep your hand off my settings." Her voice held bitter sharpness. "I don't want to be
awake."
He seated himself beside her, bent over her, and explained softly. "If you set the surge up
high enough, you'll be glad you're awake; that's the whole point. At setting C it overcomes the
threshold barring consciousness, as it does for me." Friendlily, because he felt welldisposed toward the world his setting had been at D — he patted her bare, pate shoulder.
"Get your crude cop's hand away," Iran said.
"I'm not a cop — " He felt irritable, now, although he hadn't dialed for it.
"You're worse," his wife said, her eyes still shut. "You're a murderer hired by the cops. 
"I've never killed a human being in my life." His irritability had risen, now; had become
outright hostility.
Iran said, "Just those poor andys."
"I notice you've never had any hesitation as to spending the bounty money I bring home on
whatever momentarily attracts your attention." He rose, strode to the console of his mood
organ. "Instead of saving," he said, "so we could buy a real sheep, to replace that fake
electric one upstairs. A mere electric animal, and me earning all that I've worked my way up
to through the years." At his console he hesitated between dialing for a thalamic suppressant
(which would abolish his mood of rage) or a thalamic stimulant (which would make him irked
enough to win the argument).
"If you dial," Iran said, eyes open and watching, "for greater venom, then I'll dial the same.
I'll dial the maximum and you'll see a fight that makes every argument we've had up to now
seem like nothing. Dial and see; just try me." She rose swiftly, loped to the console of her
own mood organ, stood glaring at him, waiting.
He sighed, defeated by her threat. "I'll dial what's on my schedule for today." Examining
the schedule for January 3, 1992, he saw that a businesslike professional attitude was called
for. "If I dial by schedule," he said warily, "will you agree to also?" He waited, canny enough
not to commit himself until his wife had agreed to follow suit.
"My schedule for today lists a six-hour self-accusatory depression," Iran said.
"What? Why did you schedule that?" It defeated the whole purpose of the mood organ. "I
didn't even know you could set it for that," he said gloomily.
"I was sitting here one afternoon," Iran said, "and naturally I had tamed on Buster Friendly
and His Friendly Friends and he was talking about a big news item he's about to break and
then that awful commercial came on, the one I hate; you know, for Mountibank Lead
Codpieces. And so for a minute I shut off the sound. And I heard the building, this building; I
heard the — " She gestured.
"Empty apartments," Rick said. Sometimes he heard them at night when he was
supposed to be asleep. And yet, for this day and age a one-half occupied conapt building
rated high in the scheme of population density; out in what had been before the war the
suburbs one could find buildings entirely empty . . . or so he had heard. He had let the
information remain secondhand; like most people he did not care to experience it directly.
"At that moment," Iran said, "when I had the TV sound off, I was in a 382 mood; I had just
dialed it. So although I heard the emptiness intellectually, I didn't feel it. My first reaction
consisted of being grateful that we could afford a Penfield mood organ. But then I read how
unhealthy it was, sensing the absence of life, not just in this building but everywhere, and not
reacting — do you see? I guess you don't. But that used to be considered a sign of mental
illness; they called it 'absence of appropriate affect.' So I left the TV sound off and I sat down
at my mood organ and I experimented. And I finally found a setting for despair." Her dark,
pert face showed satisfaction, as if she had achieved something of worth. "So I put it on my
schedule for twice a month; I think that's a reasonable amount of time to feel hopeless about
everything, about staying here on Earth after everybody who's small has emigrated, don't you
think?"
"But a mood like that," Rick said, "you're apt to stay in it, not dial your way out. Despair
like that, about total reality, is self-perpetuating."
"I program an automatic resetting for three hours later," his wife said sleekly. "A 481.
Awareness of the manifold possibilities open to me in the future; new hope that — "
"I know 481," he interrupted. He had dialed out the combination many times; he relied on it
greatly. "Listen," he said, seating himself on his bed and taking hold of her hands to draw her
down beside him, "even with an automatic cutoff it's dangerous to undergo a depression,
any kind. Forget what you've scheduled and I'll fo get what I've scheduled; we'll dial a 104 
together and both experience it, and then you stay in it while I reset mine for my usual
businesslike attitude. That way I'll want to hop up to the roof and check out the sheep and
then head for the office; meanwhile I'll know you're not sitting here brooding with no TV." He
released her slim, long fingers, passed through the spacious apartment to the living room,
which smelled faintly of last night's cigarettes. There he bent to turn on the TV.
From the bedroom Iran's voice came. "I can't stand TV before breakfast."
"Dial 888," Rick said as the set warmed. "The desire to watch TV, no matter what's on it."
"I don't feel like dialing anything at all now," Iran said.
"Then dial 3," he said.
"I can't dial a setting that stimulates my cerebral cortex into wanting to dial! If I don't want to
dial, I don't want to dial that most of all, because then I will want to dial, and wanting to dial is
right now the most alien drive I can imagine; I just want to sit here on the bed and stare at the
floor." Her voice had become sharp with overtones of bleakness as her soul congealed and
she ceased to move, as the instinctive, omnipresent film of great weight, of an almost
absolute inertia, settled over her.
He turned up the TV sound, and the voice of Buster Friendly boomed out and filled the
room. " — ho ho, folks. Time now for a brief note on today's weather. The Mongoose satellite
reports that fallout will be especially pronounced toward noon and will then taper off, so all
you folks who'll be venturing out — "
Appearing beside him, her long nightgown trailing wispily, Iran shut off the TV set. "Okay, I
give up; I'll dial. Anything you want me to be; ecstatic sexual bliss — I feel so bad I'll even
endure that. What the hell. What difference does it make?"
"I'll dial for both of us, Rick said, and led her back into the bedroom. There, at her console,
he dialed 594: pleased acknowledgment of husband's superior wisdom in all matters. On his
own console he dialed for a creative and fresh attitude toward his job, although this he hardly
needed; such was his habitual, innate approach without recourse to Penfield artificial brain
stimulation.
After a hurried breakfast — he had lost time due to the discussion with his wife — he
ascended clad for venturing out, including his Ajax model Mountibank Lead Codpiece, to the
covered roof pasture whereon his electric sheep "grazed." Whereon it, sophisticated piece
of hardware that it was, chomped away in simulated contentment, bamboozling the other
tenants of the building.
Of course, some of their animals undoubtedly consisted of electronic circuitry fakes, too;
he had of course never nosed into the matter, any more than they, his neighbors, had pried
into the real workings of his sheep. Nothing could be more impolite. To say, "Is your sheep
genuine?" would be a worse breach of manners than to inquire whether a citizen's teeth,
hair, or internal organs would test out authentic.
The morning air, spilling over with radioactive motes, gray and sun — beclouding, belched
about him, haunting his nose; fie sniffed involuntarily the taint of death. Well, that was too
strong a description for it, he decided as he made his way to the particular plot of sod which
he owned along with the unduly large apartment below. The legacy of World War Terminus
had diminished in potency; those who could not survive the dust had passed into oblivion
years ago, and the dust, weaker now and confronting the strong survivors, only deranged
minds and genetic properties. Despite his lead codpiece the dust — undoubtedly — filtered
in and at him, brought him daily, so long as he failed to emigrate, its little load of befouling
filth. So far, medical checkups taken monthly confirmed him as a regular: a man who could
reproduce within the tolerances set by law. Any month, however, the exam by the San
Francisco Police Department doctors could reveal otherwise. Continually, new specials
came into existence, created out of regulars by the omnipresent dust. The saying currently 
blabbed by posters, TV ads, and government junk mail, ran: "Emigrate or degenerate! The
choice is yours! " Very true, Rick thought as he opened the gate to his little pasture and
approached his electric sheep. But I can't emigrate, he said to himself. Because of my job.
The owner of the adjoining pasture, his conapt neighbor Bill Barbour, hailed him; he, like
Rick, had dressed for work but had stopped off on the way to check his animal, too.
"My horse," Barbour declared beamingly, "is pregnant." He indicated the big Percheron,
which stood staring off in an empty fashion into space. "What do you say to that?"
"I say pretty soon you'll have two horses," Rick said. He had reached his sheep, now; it lay
ruminating, its alert eyes fixed on him in case he had brought any rolled oats with him. The
alleged sheep contained an oat-tropic circuit; at the sight of such cereals it would scramble
up convincingly and amble over. "What's she pregnant by?" he asked Barbour. "The wind?"
"I bought some of the highest quality fertilizing plasma available in California," Barbour
informed him. "Through inside contacts I have with the State Animal Husbandry Board. Don't
you remember last week when their inspector was out here examining Judy? They're eager
to have her foal; she's an unmatched superior." Barbour thumped his horse fondly on the
neck and she inclined her head toward him.
"Ever thought of selling your horse?" Rick asked. He wished to god he had a horse, in fact
any animal. Owning and maintaining a fraud had a way of gradually demoralizing one. And
yet from a social standpoint it had to be done, given the absence of the real article. He had
therefore no choice except to continue. Even were he not to care himself, there remained his
wife, and Iran did care. Very much.
Barbour said, "It would be immoral to sell my horse."
"Sell the colt, then. Having two animals is more immoral than not having any."
Puzzled, Barbour said, "How do you mean? A lot of people have two animals, even three,
four, and like in the case of Fred Washborne, who owns the algae-processing plant my
brother works at, even five. Didn't you see that article about his duck in yesterday's
Chronicle? It's supposed to be the heaviest, largest Moscovy on the West Coast." The
man's eyes glazed over, imagining such possessions; he drifted by degrees into a trance.
Exploring about in his coat pockets, Rick found his creased, much-studied copy of
Sidney's Animal & Fowl Catalogue January supplement. He looked in the index, found colts
(vide horses, offsp.) and presently had the prevailing national price. "I can buy a Percheron
colt from Sidney's for five thousand dollars," he said aloud.
"No you can't," Barbour said. "Look at the listing again; it's in italics. That means they don't
have any in stock, but that would be the price if they did have."
"Suppose," Rick said, "I pay you five hundred dollars a month for ten months. Full
catalogue value."
Pityingly, Barbour said, "Deckard, you don't understand about horses; there's a reason
why Sidney's doesn't have any Percheron colts in stock. Percheron colts just don't change
hands — at catalogue value, even. They're too scarce, even relatively inferior ones." He
leaned across their common fence, gesticulating. "I've had Judy for three years and not in all
that time have I seen a Percheron mare of her quality. To acquire her I had to fly to Canada,
and I personally drove her back here myself to make sure she wasn't stolen. You bring an
animal like this anywhere around Colorado or Wyoming and they'll knock you off to get hold
of it. You know why? Because back before W.W.T. there existed literally hundreds — "
"But," Rick interrupted, "for you to have two horses and me none, that violates the whole
basic theological and moral structure of Mercerism."
"You have your sheep; hell, you can follow the Ascent in your individual life, and when you
grasp the two handles of empathy you approach honorably. Now if you didn't have that old
sheep, there, I'd see some logic in your position. Sure, if I had two animals and you didn't
have any, I'd be helping deprive you of true fusion with Mercer. But every family in this 
building — let's see; around fifty: one to every three apts, as I compute it — every one of us
has an animal of some sort. Graveson has that chicken over there." He gestured north.
"Oakes and his wife have that big red dog that barks in the night." He pondered. "I think Ed
Smith has a cat down in his apt; — at least he says so, but no one's ever seen it. Possibly
he's just pretending."
Going over to his sheep, Rick bent down, searching in the thick white wool — the fleece at
least was genuine — until he found what he was looking for: the concealed control panel of
the mechanism. As Barbour watched he snapped open the panel covering, revealing it.
"See?" he said to Barbour. "You understand now why I want your colt so badly?"
After an interval Barbour said, "You poor guy. Has it always been this way?"
"No," Rick said, once again closing the panel covering of his electric sheep; he
straightened up, turned, and faced his neighbor. "I had a real sheep, originally. My wife's
father gave it to us outright when he emigrated. Then, about a year ago, remember that time I
took it to the vet — you were up here that morning when I came out and found it lying on its
side and it couldn't get up."
"You got it to its feet," Barbour said, remembering and nodding. "Yeah, you managed to
lift it up but then after a minute or two of walking around it fell over again."
Rick said, "Sheep get strange diseases. Or put another way, sheep get a lot of diseases
but the symptoms are always the same; the sheep can't get up and there's no way to tell how
serious it is, whether it's a sprained leg or the animal's dying of tetanus. That's what mine
died of; tetanus."
"Up here?" Barbour said. "On the roof?"
"The hay," Rick explained. "That one time I didn't get all the wire off the bale; I left a piece
and Groucho — that's what I called him, then — got a scratch and in that way contracted
tetanus. I took him to the vet's and he died, and I thought about it, and finally I called one of
those shops that manufacture artificial animals and I showed them a photograph of Groucho.
They made this." He indicated the reclining ersatz animal, which continued to ruminate
attentively, still watching alertly for any indication of oats. "It's a premium job. And I've put as
much time and attention into caring for it as I did when it was real. But — " He shrugged.
"It's not the same," Barbour finished.
"But almost. You feel the same doing it; you have to keep your eye on it exactly as you did
when it was really alive. Because they break down and then everyone in the building knows.
I've had it at the repair shop six times, mostly little malfunctions, but if anyone saw them — for
instance one time the voice tape broke or anyhow got fouled and it wouldn't stop baaing —
they'd recognize it as a mechanical breakdown." He added, "The repair outfit's truck is of
course marked 'animal hospital something.' And the driver dresses like a vet, completely in
white." He glanced suddenly at his watch, remembering the time. "I have to get to work," he
said to Barbour. "I'll see you this evening."
As he started toward his car Barbour called after him hurriedly, "Um, I won't say anything to
anybody here in the building."
Pausing, Rick started to say thanks. But then something of the despair that Iran had been
talking about tapped him on the shoulder and he said, "I don't know; maybe it doesn't make
any difference."
"But they'll look down on you. Not all of them, but some. You know how people are about
not taking care of an animal; they consider it immoral and anti-empathic. I mean, technically
it's not a crime like it was right after W. .T. but the feeling's still there."
"God," Rick said futilely, and gestured empty-handed. "I want to have an animal; I keep
trying to buy one. But on my salary, on what a city employee makes — " If, he thought, I could
get lucky in my work again. As I did two years ago when I managed to bag four andys during
one month. If I had known then, he thought, that Groucho was going to die . . . but that had 
been before the tetanus. Before the two-inch piece of broken, hypodermic-like baling wire.
"You could buy a cat," Barbour offered. "Cats are cheap; look in your Sidney's catalogue."
Rick said quietly, "I don't want a domestic pet. I want what I originally had, a large animal.
A sheep or if I can get the money a cow or a steer or what you have; a horse." The bounty
from retiring five andys would do it, he realized. A thousand dollars apiece, over and above
my salary. Then somewhere I could find, from someone, what I want. Even if the listing in
Sidney's Animal & Fowl is in italics. Five thousand dollars — but, he thought, the five andys
first have to make their way to Earth from one of the colony planets; I can't control that, I can't
make five of them come here, and even if I could there are other bounty hunters with other
police agencies throughout the world. The andys would specifically have to take up
residence in Northern California, and the senior bounty hunter in this area, Dave Holden,
would have to die or retire.
"Buy a cricket," Barbour suggested wittily. "Or a mouse. Hey, for twenty-five bucks you can
buy a full-grown mouse."
Rick said, "Your horse could die, like Groucho died, without warning. When you get home
from work this evening you could find her laid out on her back, her feet in the air, like a bug.
Like what you said, a cricket." He strode off, car key in his hand.
"Sorry if I offended you," Barbour said nervously.
In silence Rick Deckard plucked open the door of his hovercar. He had nothing further to
say to his neighbor; his mind was on his work, on the day ahead.
